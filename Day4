Today is Day 4

1. I don't practice today for Hindi typing. 


2. Explore the GitHub App.
  a. created a github app name as : vklucifer80githubapp1


3. Need to explore the integration of github and webex. 
  a. Alert by github to the webex only specific branch. 

4. "Zuo" has become the intermediate in the jenkins. 

5. Discussion tab was available in between pull request and Actions tab. 

6. As I work today in one of the cases where the user was confused about the "Generated a Identity token" and "access token". User say that if idendity token will expire after 90 days with repective to this all access token will revoke. 
  But when I try on this case as per the user request, I found that this is not possible. As identity token and access token are same.
  With the help of an access token, we can able to generate a new token. 
  And if the identity token is revoked or expired, with respective of all access tokens will not effect.
